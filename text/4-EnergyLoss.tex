\chapter{\label{ch:4-energyloss}Energy Loss in Liquid Argon} 

\minitoc

This chapter will cover in more detail both the theory and measurement of
electromagnetic energy loss in liquid argon. Energy loss for both electrons and
photons will be discussed and the implications of this for electron
reconstruction at different energy scales will be highlighted. 

The work in this section is complete and part of this work was reported in the
document submitted for transfer of status.
