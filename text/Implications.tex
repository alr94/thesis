\chapter{\label{ch:implications}Implications for DUNE} 

% \minitoc

This chapter will analyse the implications of the measured uncertainties on
analyses for the DUNE experiment. In particular the impact of the measured
energy scale uncertainty and energy scale bias on supernova neutrino physics in
DUNE will be analysed. The difference in conditions between ProtoDUNE--SP and
DUNE will be highlighted and the expected implications for energy scale
uncertainties in DUNE will be discussed.

The work for this section has yet to be started as it will be dependent on the
outcome of the Michel electron analysis in the previous section. I expect to be
able to start work on this analysis in September/October 2019 after preliminary
results of the Michel electron analysis; work for this section will be completed
by the end of December 2019.
