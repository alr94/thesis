\chapter{\label{ch:3-protodune}The ProtoDUNE--SP Detector} 

\minitoc

This chapter will discuss the ProtoDUNE--SP experiment and it's role in the
development of the proposed DUNE experiment. The LArTPC technology will be
detailed in the general case and then the specifics of the ProtoDUNE--SP
detector will be given. Details of the major particle fluxes in ProtoDUNE--SP
will be outlined, along with a discussion of the simulation and reconstruction
of each flux. Finally, as my main contribution to detector operations during
data taking was developing for the ProtoDUNE--SP online monitoring system, this
will be discussed in more depth. 

The work for the online monitoring subsection has been completed as part of my
duties as an on--site expert at CERN. I expect to be able to complete the rest
of the work by the end of December 2019 alongside the other analysis work.
